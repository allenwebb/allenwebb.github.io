## Vegetable Dishes

## Meat Recipes

* [(external) BBQ country style ribs](https://www.food.com/recipe/the-most-tender-country-style-honey-bbq-ribs-501742): The amount of ribs isn't super important and the additional spices and seasoning can be omitted so that it is just the barbecue sauce and ribs. Note that country style ribs aren't really ribs but are a cut of meat that mimics ribs.
