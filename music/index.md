# Music

Music helps me focus on whatever I need to at the time and in some cases helps adjust my mood. I have created playlists to group music based on how I am feeling or what I need at the particular time. Note that I try to avoid music with lyrics because that can be distracting, but it may still have vocals. Here are some of them:
